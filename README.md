# Stop-Sign-Detector
This Python project uses OpenCV and iPhone as camera to detect stop signs while driving and provide an audible warning if it detected a stop sign. 

##Setup for Testing
To test the program in real-time, I used the free version of the [EpocCam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483) app on my iPhone to use its camera, and connected it to my laptop running the program via USB. If you decide to use the EpocCam app, you will also need to download drivers on your computer [here](https://www.kinoni.com/). I placed the phone in the lower right side of the windshield using sticky tack.
